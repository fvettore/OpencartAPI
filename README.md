# OpencartAPI
Simple library to manipulate product catalog in OpenCart

This simple library was developed in order to synch online OpenCart store site with the internal ERP based on IBM ISeries (AKA AS400..).
It implements some basic catalog operations only:

*add product

*enable/disable product

*set main porduct characteristics as multilanguage description, images, quantity, prices discount, quantity-discounts....

Tested with OpenCart 3.x and 4.x and PHP 7> (probably working 5.x tooo)

See examples for usage.

DISCLAIMER: Code is neither solid nor well written so... use it at your own risk and consider I AM NOT A PHP DEVELOPER :)
An improper use of this sotware can damage your OpenCart databse integrity.

If you like it plase offer me a coffe (paypal fabrizio at vettore dot org)
